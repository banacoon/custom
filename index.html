					<p><img src="assets/images/letter-i.svg" alt="I" class="paragraph__letter"> t is not always possible to jet off half way around the world when you and your significant other are wishing to go off on a private and romantic getaway. The great news is that you don’t have to spend a lot of money or go very far to get away from everyone and everything. You can find cheap romantic vacations nearby, and you may not have to look much further than the Internet to find great packages that you can afford.</p>
					<p>You may think of creepy resorts when you think of cheap romantic vacations, but you can leave these to the movies. You can usually find a great bed and breakfast near you that will offer you privacy and romance at an amazingly low price. You may only have to drive an hour to get away, and you will find that you love the romance such a setting will provide to you. These cheap romantic vacations are often set in rural areas that offer natural beauty and small town charm. You won’t even have to leave your room to enjoy either one. You can also find cheap romantic vacations if you look online for discount travel sites. </p>
					<p>These sites have packages that are meant just for lovers, and they know what you need when you are looking for cheap romantic vacations.</p>

					<p><img src="assets/images/woman.png" alt="woman" class="paragraph__woman"> You may find something that jets syou off to another part of the country for a short three or four-day getaway that affords you what you need at a price you can afford. Cheap doesn’t mean it will be cheesy for the most part. Although, when you are looking to save some money on a trip, you do really have to watch out. My honeymoon was ruined because I didn’t look into things like I should have.</p>
					<p>When you are offered packages for cheap romantic vacations make sure you check up on what you are being offered before you sign on the dotted line. There are some places that misrepresent what they are, and you don’t want to be disappointed when you get there. Look online for reviews of each place from others who have gone there for cheap romantic vacations and see what they have to say. If the place seems to have disappointed more than one couple, you should definitely think twice before you go there. If you find this is the case, keep looking. Something better will pop up if you keep searching.</p>
